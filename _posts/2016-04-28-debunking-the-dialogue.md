# Debunking The Discourse

Language doesn't have a fixed reference point. Intention and presentation dominate perception. Shaping collective awareness around climate change is essential and complex. The implications of a changing climate must be translated through culture, politics, media, and dialects. Effective communication is more important than ever both within localities and between nations. Invoke is an organisation focused on the experience of vulnerable Pacific nations, the challenges they face, and the importance of transmitting information from a region which is both the frontline for climate change risk and the starting point for unique opportunities and solutions. Within this Communication is key.

# Concept Check 

## Climate change = hard work, hippies and alarmism?

Climate change = a life threatening global issue that requires a concerted international effort to ensure life can remain enjoyable and the future less alarming.

## Communism= an evil concept aimed at restricting individual growth?

Communism = At its root, communism is about a system defined by both the individual and collective. The focus is on positive, sustainable, human growth rather than environmentally detrimental and socially alienating capital. Because 'Communism' is a word marred by negative historic permutations of the concept there is little incentive to use this term when defining solutions despite the many valuable insights it could provide. A more useful concept is the growing acceptance (crowdfunding, sourcing) of the value of mass contribution - lets call it 'contributor culture'. Are you a communist? no, I'm a 'Contributor'.

## Austerity = Fortification, Safety for all?

In practice austerity is about reducing relative security for the individual in order to benefit the state. Its about holding back resources to keep non-communal aspects of society functional. Austerity is about retaining power in a very specific place.

We can compare these terms to a house built by an architect. The architect's intention and vision for the structure no longer matter's once the property is purchased. What really matters is who moves in, occupies the house, decorates it, establishes it, presents it.

The command of language dominates international soft power and underpins the ability of the few to manipulate the discourse. Hierarchy is defined through language and the resulting ability to control laws and resources. The climate crisis is as much driven by our preconceptions ingrained in language and communication as it is in the resulting actions. 

# Changing the Discourse is the first step

These discourses are directed by the status quo. The same status quo that has dominated global decision making, resource use, and national priorities for generations. This status quo dominates our perception and directs the way individuals take up these terms, attribute value, and relate to societies hierarchy. 

The remote communal cultures and societies with close connection to nature based livelihoods found in the Pacific, provides a unique angle from which to view our current problems. The Pacific offers many lessons useful for a changing world - a place where traditional culture struggle against development, where small populations and economies are under pressure to adapt to intensifying environmental threats. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dffb379a-0606-4536-9722-71729a09b87b.jpg)

Children can't speak but in their actions show everything that is important to life - food, water, friends, sleep, comfort, shelter.

Children undermine our power perceptions, unaware of hierarchy, playful with language, open to new things always. 

Our consumer dependance renders us vulnerable to large inefficient systems of supply and demand which are currently falling apart..

Innovation starts with communication.
