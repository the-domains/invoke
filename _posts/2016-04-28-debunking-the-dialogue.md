# Debunking The Dialogue

Language doesn't have a fixed reference point. Intention and presentation dominate perception.

## Climate change = hard work, hippies and alarmism

Climate change = a life threatening global issue that requires a concerted international effort to ensure life can remain enjoyable and anything but alarming

# Communism = an evil concept aimed at restricting individual growth

At its root, communism is about a system defined by integrated individuals and collective, positive, sustainable growth. 

# Austerity = Fortification, Safety for all

In practice austerity is about reducing relative security for the individual in order to benefit the state. Its about holding back resources to keep non-communal aspects of society functional. Austerity is about retaining power in a very specific place.

The discourse is directed by the status quo. The status quo dominates our perception and directs the way individuals uptake these terms.

We can compare these terms to a house built by an architect. The architect's intention and vision for the structure doesn't matter as soon as the property is purchased. What really matter's is who moves in, occupies the house and defines how it is perceived. 

The command of language dominates international soft power and underpins the ability of the few to manipulate the discourse. Hierarchy is defined through lanaguage and the resulting ability to control laws and resources.
