## Understanding the risks associated with climate change requires us to understand and accept interconnected models of **cause and effect**. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1cf775ed14e3533deffe46db90213c78/passthrough.jpg?height=530&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F5990334321d8da052e5a625753e768361d9c2205.jpg&width=750)

In the vulnerable nations of the Pacific, drastic preparation is required to counter-act the challenges posed by climate change and there is an ever increasing reliance on governments, donors and technical specialists to deliver solutions.

At Invoke, we believe that resilience is best built from the ground up. Livelihoods must adjust and adapt. Lifestyles, economy's and national interests must be recalibrated. 

Communication between all stakeholders is key to ensuring the development of effective adaptation solutions and collaborative integration of the varied interests across sectors, companies, donors, and communities is far from easy

Clear advocacy, greater cross-discipline networking, an inclusive approach to community support, and a more defined outlook on social responsibility is required.

Invoke is a social enterprise designed to enable innovation for adaptation.
