# Work With Us

At INVOKE, we focus on the messages that can shift behavior, produce new livelihood options and realign our priorities to match our environmental constraints.Climate change requires us to understand interconnected models of **cause and effect**.

## Only through Collaboration can our lifestyles, economies and priorities be safely recalibrated.

### In the vulnerable nations of the Pacific, drastic preparation is required to counter-act the challenges posed by climate change and resulting in an ever increasing reliance on governments, donors and technical specialists to deliver solutions. Communication between all stakeholders is essential to ensuring the development of effective adaptation solutions. 

INVOKE seeks to operationalize the integration of varied interests across sectors, companies, donors, and communities.We do this through clear advocacy, cross-discipline networking, an inclusive approach to resources, a strong mandate on social responsibility, and cutting edge media solutions.
