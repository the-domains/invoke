## CATALYST: LOW CARBON SEA TRANSPORT

The Pacific SIDS are a unique group of countries. Within small nations, 70% of fossil fuel use is on transport. Many of the Pacific states are deeply dependent on transport for basic functionality and have high dependance on fossil fuels per capita.

There are many reasons that the Pacific region, the world's largest ocean, is well suited to serve as a testing ground for transport innovation. Successful transport alternatives would drastically alter the entire profile of Pacific development due to the region's high dependance on expensive long distance transport. Nowhere else are the incentives so high and the conditions so readily available for the full spectrum of renewable technology (wind, solar, wave, geothermal).

**Transport has defined Pacific cultures...**

True innovation is born out of pressure and crisis. The Pacific has been defining transport for centuries. The steam engine's first successful application was as a a power source for ships. This application paved the way to an energy revolution which has created a global economy dependent still on what was the roots of the transition: shipping. Ships move the worlds resources, planes move the worlds people. Shipping is deeply integral to fossil fuel industries and continues to enable global fossil fuel value due to the ongoing ability to move oil by burning oil.

Low carbon shipping would influence our fossil fuel use at its entry point. The first time oil is shipped using low carbon transport is the first time the overall emissions per barrel of oil is reduced at source. Decarbonizing the worlds most inefficient and outdated transport sector will has the potential to have the same ripple effect that the the sail, steam engine, and petrol engine had.

Our economies have always been intrinsically linked to our mobility both as people (traders) and ability to move goods. Until we address this, we are merely delaying and curtailing ambition. Changing ships changes demand types, is a catalyst for change and is an accessible starting point with many technologies already developed. Though the technology may be available, it is held up by policy and the tightly wound knot that links the shipping industry to resource extraction and fossil fuels.

**Decarbonization can only happen following a specific order of priorities. Most importantly we need to use transport policy to regulate agriculture:**

1) Transport methods control the mobility of products and is an integral component when defining agriculture and trade policy

2) Agriculture methodologies define the way we impact 1/3 of the worlds land area

3) Redefine methods of electricity production / fossil fuel use / Industry

= Overall shift in production and consumption profile
