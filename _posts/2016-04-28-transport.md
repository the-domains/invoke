## CATALYST:LOW CARBON TRANSPORT

The Pacific SIDS are a unique group of countries. Within small nations, 70% of fossil fuel use is on transport. Many of the Pacific states are deeply dependent on transport for basic functionality and have high dependance on fossil fuels per capita.

There are many reasons that the Pacific region, the world's largest ocean, is well suited to serve as a testing ground for transport innovation. One reason is that success would drastically alter the entire profile of Pacific development. Nowhere else are the incentives so high, the conditions so readily available for the full spectrum of renewable technology (wind, solar, wave, geothermal). 

**Transport has defined the cultures of the Pacific. **

**the global economy to the degree the Pacific is and in no place is the climate change so aggressive. Innovation is usually born out of pressure and crisis. The Pacific has been defining transport for centuries. The steam engines first application was shipping. This application lead to the fossil fuel era and an energy revolution which has created a global economy dependant on the roots of the transition -- shipping. Ships move the worlds resources, planes move the worlds people. Shipping is deeply integral to fossil fuel industries and continues to enable global fossil fuel value due to the ongoing ability to move oil by burning oil. Low carbon shipping would influence our fossil fuel use at its entry point. The first time oil is shipped using low carbon transport is the first time the overall emissions per barrel of oil is reduced at source. Decarbonising the worlds most inefficient and outdated transport sector will has the potential to have the same ripple effect that the the sail, steam engine, and petrol engine had. Our economies have always been intrinsically linked to our mobility both as people (traders) and ability to move goods. Until we address this, we are merely delaying and curtailing ambition. Changing ships changes demand types, is a catalyst for change and is an easy starting point with many technologies ready to go, held up by policy and the tightly wound knot that links the shipping industry to resource extraction and fossil fuels. Decarbonisation can only happen following a specific order of priorities. Most importantly we need to use transport policy to regulate agriculture --**
